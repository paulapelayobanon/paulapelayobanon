- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Paula Pelayo BaÃ±Ã³n and I'm based in Vienna
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R for my Master's program. I might learn other languages in the future but for the moment let's stick to R
- ğŸ‘€ Apart from R, Iâ€™m interested in (non-programming) languages, history, culture, food, cooking and some other stuff I don't want to bore you with
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a geography addict and can name random facts about countries, regions and cities
